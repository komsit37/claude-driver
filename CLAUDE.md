# CLAUDE.md - Browser Interactive Control System

This repository contains a Python-based browser automation system that allows Claude Code to interactively control web browsers through file-based communication. The system captures both HTML content and screenshots for comprehensive web analysis and automation.

## üöÄ Quick Start Commands

### Setup & Dependencies
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync
uv run playwright install

# Start browser in file-based control mode (recommended for Claude Code)
uv run python main.py file

# Start browser in interactive mode (for manual testing)
uv run python main.py
```

### Common Development Commands
```bash
# Run Amazon order extraction example
uv run python amazon/extract_order.py

# Check project structure
ls -la

# View logs
tail -f ./tmp/browser.log

# Clean temporary files
rm -rf ./tmp/*
```

## üèóÔ∏è High-Level Architecture

### Core Components

1. **main.py** - Primary browser automation engine
   - `BrowserController` class: Main automation controller with Playwright integration
   - Dual-mode operation: Interactive CLI and file-based communication
   - Smart state capture: HTML + optimized screenshots for Claude Code analysis
   - Comprehensive command processing with 15+ automation commands

2. **File-Based Communication System**
   - `./tmp/commands.txt` - Claude Code writes commands here
   - `./tmp/results.txt` - Browser execution results in JSON format
   - `./tmp/page_XXX.html` - Complete HTML content capture
   - `./tmp/screenshot_XXX.png` - Visual page state (auto-resized to 800px width)
   - `./tmp/browser.log` - Detailed execution and debugging logs

3. **Amazon Integration Example** (`amazon/` folder)
   - `extract_order.py` - Advanced order data extraction with deduplication
   - `orders.json` - Clean extracted order data (10 unique orders, ¬•179,151 total)
   - Demonstrates real-world e-commerce automation patterns

### Key Technical Features

- **Chrome Integration**: Uses system Chrome browser via Playwright
- **Smart Element Detection**: Multiple strategies for finding clickable elements
- **Advanced Data Extraction**: Auto-detection of products, tables, forms, contacts
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and graceful failure recovery
- **Coordinate-Precise Clicking**: Text-based element finding with exact coordinates
- **Dynamic Content Support**: Smart waiting for AJAX and SPA content loads

## üéØ Common Use Cases & Commands

### Web Navigation & Analysis
```bash
# Navigate to website
echo "navigate https://example.com" > ./tmp/commands.txt

# Capture current page state
echo "capture" > ./tmp/commands.txt

# Scroll to load more content
echo "scroll down 5" > ./tmp/commands.txt

# Wait for dynamic content
echo "wait .product-list" > ./tmp/commands.txt
```

### Smart Data Extraction
```bash
# Auto-detect and extract all data types
echo "extract auto" > ./tmp/commands.txt

# Focus on specific data types
echo "extract products" > ./tmp/commands.txt
echo "extract tables" > ./tmp/commands.txt
echo "extract contacts" > ./tmp/commands.txt

# Get page structure overview
echo "structure" > ./tmp/commands.txt

# Extract all links
echo "links" > ./tmp/commands.txt

# Find elements by text content
echo "find Add to Cart" > ./tmp/commands.txt
```

### Interactive Control
```bash
# Click at specific coordinates
echo "click 400 300" > ./tmp/commands.txt

# Type text in focused field
echo "type Hello World" > ./tmp/commands.txt

# Press keyboard keys
echo "key Enter" > ./tmp/commands.txt
echo "key Tab" > ./tmp/commands.txt
```

## üîß Development Patterns

### Adding New Commands
1. Add command pattern in `execute_command()` function (main.py:436-502)
2. Implement handler method in `BrowserController` class
3. Update README.md documentation
4. Test with both file and interactive modes

### Data Extraction Best Practices
- Use BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing and data structuring
- Implement deduplication logic (see amazon/extract_order.py:184-217)
- Filter unrealistic data (price ranges, content length validation)
- Score containers to identify relevant content (main.py:78-87)
- Limit results to prevent data overload (products[:20], links[:50])

### Error Handling Approach
- Comprehensive logging to ./tmp/browser.log
- Graceful degradation on element not found
- JSON error responses with actionable messages
- Browser session preservation on command failures

## üé® Claude Code Integration Tips

### Sub-Agent Capabilities
Claude Code can spawn sub-agents for specialized tasks:
- **Claude sub-agents**: Use for general automation, web interaction, and data extraction tasks
- **Gemini sub-agents**: Use for long context tasks like analyzing or summarizing large HTML files, processing extensive extracted data, or reviewing large log files
- **Task delegation**: `Task` tool allows spawning concurrent agents for complex multi-step workflows

### Effective Workflow
1. **Always capture state** after navigation: `echo "capture" > ./tmp/commands.txt`
2. **Use smart extraction** for unknown pages: `echo "extract auto" > ./tmp/commands.txt`
3. **Find elements by text** for reliable clicking: `echo "find Login" > ./tmp/commands.txt`
4. **Wait for dynamic content** before proceeding: `echo "wait [data-loaded='true']" > ./tmp/commands.txt`
5. **Delegate analysis tasks**: Use Gemini sub-agents for processing large HTML files or summarizing extensive extraction results

### Reading Results
- Check `./tmp/results.txt` for JSON-formatted command results
- Screenshots auto-resized to 800px width for optimal Claude Code analysis
- HTML files contain complete page source for deep content analysis
- Logs provide detailed execution context for debugging

### Advanced Automation Patterns
- **Multi-step workflows**: Chain commands with state capture between steps
- **Form automation**: Use `echo "forms" > ./tmp/commands.txt` to analyze form fields
- **Content monitoring**: Regular capture + comparison for change detection
- **E-commerce automation**: Product extraction + cart operations + checkout flows

## üîç Dependencies & Requirements

### Core Dependencies (pyproject.toml)
- `playwright>=1.40.0` - Browser automation engine
- `pillow>=10.0.0` - Image processing for screenshot optimization
- `pyautogui>=0.9.54` - Additional GUI automation capabilities
- `beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0` - HTML parsing and data extraction

### System Requirements
- Python 3.12+
- Chrome browser installed
- uv package manager (recommended) or pip

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Ethics

- **Defensive automation only** - No malicious or unauthorized access patterns
- **Rate limiting built-in** - Delays and timeouts to respect server resources
- **Local data storage** - All captures and extractions stay on local machine
- **Respect robots.txt** - User responsibility to follow website terms of service

## üí° Troubleshooting & Debugging

### Common Issues
- **EOF errors in interactive mode**: Use file mode instead (`python main.py file`)
- **Blank screenshots**: Check Chrome browser installation and permissions
- **Element not found**: Use `find` command to locate elements by text first
- **AJAX content missing**: Use `wait` command with appropriate selector

### Debug Resources
- `./tmp/browser.log` - Detailed execution logs with timestamps
- `./tmp/page_XXX.html` - Complete HTML source for inspection
- Screenshot sequence for visual debugging workflow
- JSON results with error messages and status codes
