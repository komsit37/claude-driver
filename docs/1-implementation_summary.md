## 🚀 Usage Examples

### **Claude's Typical Workflow**
```bash
# 1. Start driver (human)
python core/driver.py http

# 2. Navigate and capture (Claude)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/capture

# 3. Analyze structure (Claude)
python tools/page_analyzer.py tmp/page_latest.html

# 4. Test selectors (Claude)
python tools/selector_tester.py tmp/page_latest.html

# 5. Extract data (Claude)
cd sites/amazon && python extract_order.py

# 6. Validate results (Claude)
python ../../tools/extraction_validator.py outputs/orders.json
```

### **Adding New Site**
```bash
# 1. Copy template
cp sites/templates/basic_extractor.py sites/newsite/extractor.py

# 2. Customize based on page analysis
# (Tools guide this process)

# 3. Test and validate
# (Built-in validation ensures quality)
```

## 💡 Design Philosophy Achieved
